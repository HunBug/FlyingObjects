# FlyingObjects
Simulation of flying objects

# Ideas for the project
 - one-by-one simulation vs multiple objects
 - single-threaded vs multi-threaded
 - float boundaries equality check (floats are not precise)
 - add unit test (angle normalization, regexp, etc)
 - bezier path
 - random init seed
 - all the TODOs in the code
 - consistent code style
 - read db config from env or config file
 - assuming queried data can be fit into memory. Pagination is not implemented
